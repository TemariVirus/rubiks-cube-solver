# rubiks-cube-solver
A CLI application that renders a simulated Rubik's cube and solves it.
Made this as a fun little project, will do some optimising and maybe some documentation before locking it down.

## How to use
Press the R, L, U, D, F and B keys to rotate the right, left, up, down, front, and back faces respectively 90 degrees clockwise.
Holding down the shift key will make the rotation go anticlockwise, while holding down the alt key will make it a 180 degree rotation.
Press spacebar to solve the cube and print the solution.
